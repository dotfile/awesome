Brandon's Awesome Window Manager Config
---------------------------------------

**Notes on my configuration**
* Defaults to urxvt and vim. 
* Current window is highlighted in red.

**Status / TODO** 
* I haven't run awesome in over two years;
  I'm currently running v3.4.10 under Ubuntu 11.10, and I need to port my 
  old configurations, find out what is new, etc. 
* I'm going to try to match the vim zenburn and/or lucius2 color schemes. 
* I need to figure out what to use for:
	* Network manager 
	* Compositor 
	* Tag creation / management 
* Need to get rid of gaps between windows.
